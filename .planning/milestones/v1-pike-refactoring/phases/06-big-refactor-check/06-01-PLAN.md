<objective>
Create a smoke test that validates the refactored LSP codebase works end-to-end, ensuring that module structure tests from Phase 5 translate to actual LSP functionality. This addresses the critical verification gap where 111 tests passed but real LSP features were never verified.

Purpose: Catch regressions that unit tests miss - particularly around module loading, JSON-RPC handler execution, and actual LSP feature behavior (completion, hover, go-to-definition) - before code is merged.

Output: smoke-test.pike that validates standalone file compilation, module loading, and JSON-RPC handler responses, plus a MANDATORY pre-merge checklist in CONTRIBUTING.md that requires actual LSP feature verification.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Create smoke-test.pike with end-to-end verification</name>
  <files>test/tests/smoke-test.pike</files>

  <action>
Create a comprehensive smoke test that validates:

1. **Standalone file compilation** (from RESEARCH.md Pattern 1):
   - Use compile_file() for each .pike/.pmod file
   - Files to test: analyzer.pike, module.pmod, Compat.pmod, Cache.pmod, Parser.pike, Intelligence.pike, Analysis.pike
   - Each should return a valid program (use programp() check)

2. **Module loading via resolver** (from RESEARCH.md Pattern 2):
   - Setup module path: master()->add_module_path("pike-scripts")
   - Test each module loads: LSP.module, LSP.Compat, LSP.Cache, LSP.Parser, LSP.Intelligence, LSP.Analysis
   - Verify each resolves to non-null value

3. **LSP server startup verification**:
   - Attempt to load and instantiate the main LSP server
   - Verify no errors during initialization
   - This validates SC-03 from ROADMAP ("LSP starts without errors")

4. **JSON-RPC handler smoke test** (from RESEARCH.md Pattern 3):
   - Instantiate each handler class (Parser, Intelligence, Analysis)
   - Call each handler with minimal valid params
   - Verify response has "result" field (JSON-RPC compliant)
   - Handlers to test: parse_request, tokenize_request, compile_request, batch_parse_request, handle_introspect, handle_resolve, handle_resolve_stdlib, handle_get_inherited, handle_find_occurrences, handle_analyze_uninitialized, handle_get_completion_context

Use the test framework pattern from cross-version-tests.pike:
- run_test() function with error handling
- Color output ([PASS]/[FAIL])
- Summary at end (tests run, passed, failed)
- Exit code 0 for all pass, 1 for any failure

DO NOT duplicate existing tests - this is a coordination layer that orchestrates verification patterns already established in module-load-tests.pike and cross-version-tests.pike.
  </action>

  <verify>
Run the smoke test directly: `pike test/tests/smoke-test.pike`

Expected output:
- "PASS" for each compilation test
- "PASS" for each module loading test
- "PASS" for LSP server startup test
- "PASS" for each handler test
- Summary showing all tests passed
- Exit code 0
  </verify>

  <done>
All 7 Pike files compile standalone, all 6 modules load via resolver, LSP server starts successfully, all 11 handlers return valid JSON-RPC responses. Test executes in under 5 seconds.
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Add smoke test to test runner and update CONTRIBUTING.md with REQUIRED manual verification</name>
  <files>scripts/run-pike-tests.sh, CONTRIBUTING.md</files>

  <action>
**Part 1: Update run-pike-tests.sh**

Add smoke-test.pike as the FIRST test (fail-fast):
- Insert before "Test 1: Module loading tests"
- Use: `run_test "test/tests/smoke-test.pike" "End-to-End Smoke Test"`
- This ensures smoke test runs before all other tests

**Part 2: Add Pre-Merge Verification Checklist to CONTRIBUTING.md**

Insert a new section after "Testing Guidelines" and before "Code Style":

```markdown
## Pre-Merge Verification Checklist

Before submitting any pull request, complete these steps.

### Required (ALL PRs)

- [ ] **Run smoke test**: `pike test/tests/smoke-test.pike`
  - Verify all 7 Pike files compile standalone
  - Verify all 6 LSP modules load successfully
  - Verify LSP server starts without errors
  - Verify all 11 LSP handlers return valid JSON-RPC responses

- [ ] **Run full test suite**: `./scripts/run-pike-tests.sh`
  - All 111+ tests must pass
  - CI must pass on Pike 8.1116 (required)

- [ ] **If changing Pike scripts**: Rebundle extension
  - Run: `pnpm build` (calls bundle-server.sh)
  - Verify extension bundle includes updated pike-scripts

### Required for LSP Feature Changes

**CRITICAL**: Phase 5 had 111 passing tests but actual LSP functionality was never verified. To prevent this gap, manual LSP feature testing is REQUIRED for any PR that affects LSP behavior.

- [ ] **Manual extension test**: `cd packages/vscode-pike && pnpm package && code --install-extension pike-language-server-*.vsix --force`

Then in VS Code with a Pike test file:
  - [ ] Open Pike file → no crash (SC-04)
  - [ ] Type `Array.` → completion shows stdlib methods (SC-05)
  - [ ] Type user-defined symbol name → completion works (SC-06)
  - [ ] Hover over symbol → type information shown (SC-07)
  - [ ] Ctrl+click symbol → navigates to definition (SC-08)

All five checks MUST pass before merging.

### Required for Pike Script Changes

- [ ] **Standalone compilation test**: `pike -e 'write("%d", programp(compile_file("your-file.pike")));'`
  - Must return 1 (valid program)

- [ ] **Module loading test**: After adding module path, verify `master()->resolv("LSP.YourModule")` returns non-null

- [ ] **Handler test**: Verify handler returns mapping with "result" field

### Common Failure Patterns

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| compile_file() fails | Syntax error or missing import | Check Pike syntax, verify imports |
| master()->resolv() fails | Module path not set or wrong name | Call add_module_path() first, check module name |
| Handler returns error | Missing dependency or exception | Check handler logic, verify cache/parser available |
| Tests pass but extension fails | Bundle not rebuilt | Run `pnpm build` to rebundle |
| LSP features don't work | Handler logic broken | Verify handler returns correct JSON-RPC structure |

> **Why this matters**: Phase 5 had 111 passing tests but actual LSP functionality (completion, hover, go-to-definition) was never verified. This checklist prevents that gap by requiring end-to-end verification before merges.
```

**Key changes from original draft:**
1. "Optional (For LSP Feature Changes)" → "Required for LSP Feature Changes"
2. Added explicit SC-04 through SC-08 references
3. Added "All five checks MUST pass before merging"
4. Clarified manual testing is REQUIRED for LSP behavior changes
  </action>

  <verify>
1. Run updated test runner: `./scripts/run-pike-tests.sh`
   - Smoke test should run first
   - All tests should pass

2. Check CONTRIBUTING.md has new section:
   `grep -A 70 "Pre-Merge Verification Checklist" CONTRIBUTING.md`

3. Verify section contains "Required for LSP Feature Changes" (not "Optional")
4. Verify section contains "All five checks MUST pass before merging"
  </verify>

  <done>
Smoke test runs first in test suite, CONTRIBUTING.md contains mandatory pre-merge verification checklist with REQUIRED manual LSP testing section (not optional).

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>
  After automated tasks complete, verify actual LSP functionality works in the editor:

  1. Smoke test (test/tests/smoke-test.pike) passes
  2. Full test suite passes
  3. CONTRIBUTING.md updated with pre-merge checklist
  </what-built>

  <how-to-verify>
  **Manual LSP Feature Verification (Required)**:

  1. Build and install the extension:
     ```bash
     cd packages/vscode-pike
     pnpm package
     code --install-extension pike-language-server-*.vsix --force
     ```

  2. Open VS Code and create/load a Pike test file with content like:
     ```pike
     class TestClass {
         void test_method() { }
     }

     int main() {
         TestClass tc = TestClass();
         Array arr = ({});
         return 0;
     }
     ```

  3. Verify each LSP feature:
     - [ ] **SC-04**: File opens without crash or errors
     - [ ] **SC-05**: Type `Array.` and verify completion shows stdlib methods (cast, sizeof, etc.)
     - [ ] **SC-06**: Type `tc.` and verify completion shows `test_method`
     - [ ] **SC-07**: Hover over `TestClass` or `test_method` and verify type info shows
     - [ ] **SC-08**: Ctrl+click on `test_method` and verify navigation to declaration

  4. If any check fails, note the failure details to guide fixes.

  Expected outcome: All 5 LSP features work correctly. This confirms the refactored codebase delivers actual end-to-end LSP functionality, not just passing unit tests.
  </how-to-verify>

  <resume-signal>
  After verification, report results:
  - "approved" - All 5 LSP features verified working
  - Describe any failures with details (which feature, what happened, expected vs actual)
  </resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After completion, verify:

1. **Smoke test exists**: `test/tests/smoke-test.pike` is executable
2. **Smoke test passes**: `pike test/tests/smoke-test.pike` returns exit code 0
3. **Test runner updated**: `scripts/run-pike-tests.sh` calls smoke-test.pike first
4. **Full test suite passes**: `./scripts/run-pike-tests.sh` completes successfully
5. **Documentation updated**: CONTRIBUTING.md contains "Pre-Merge Verification Checklist" section
6. **CI integration**: Smoke test runs before all other tests (fail-fast behavior)
7. **Manual LSP verification REQUIRED**: CONTRIBUTING.md marks manual testing as "Required for LSP Feature Changes" not optional
8. **LSP features verified**: Completion, hover, and go-to-definition all work in actual editor (SC-04 through SC-08)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
